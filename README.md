# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

I am in the process of a career change and this is the first project in the whole process. I'm building this websbite to become familiar with coding on a pretty basic level. I am learning how to use tools such as: Git, HTML, JavaScript, CSS and README. I ran into several issues in the intial setup but I was able to overcome these issues and became motivated after solving each one. I hope this website serves as a time capsule of sorts. Something I can look back on fondly after several years.
